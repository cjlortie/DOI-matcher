# DOI-matcher
A set of code to match DOIs for subsequent scientific object searches.
Many scientific products are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier). 
These are extemely useful in scientific synthesis work including meta-analyses and systematic reviews. 
This repo is a set of code and test for matching DOIs for repeat searches for topics from the Web of Science for instance at a later date.
